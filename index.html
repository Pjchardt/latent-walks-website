Title: Latent Walks

Abstract: The computational work of art in the age of mechanical generative reproduction reproduction.

computational - the work is performed by computing units able to run massively parallel mathematical operations

generative - having the power of origination, showing thought and spontaneity

 reproduction (biological) - the production of offspring, as opposed to the production of copies 

The assembly line introduced interchangeable parts and the conveyance of the assembly, not the assembler. The automobile assembly line in America ushered in the age of the automobile and with it vast economic gains through order of magnitude increases in productivity. Artificial intelligence, specifically generative AI and other neural network architectures, are today championed as the next paradigm shift in productivity, promising untold new gains. Architecture diagrams of individual AI systems suggest the schematics of the interchangeable machines of the 19th and early 20th century assembly lines. Like the machines, it is possible to assemble these generative systems in complex assembly line sequences, or even break out of linearity into networks, to produce exponentially more vast phenomenological sensory assets and experiences than previously possible. Questions naturally arise: how can these systems be constructed to generate new possibilities for experience and just-in-time personality-specific phenomena? How does the social nature of shared story and experience change when the story and experience is authored for each individual? What happens when changes are made to components of these generative assembly lines and how do these changes perpetuate through the system and its output? If the medium was the message in the days of McLuhan, the medium is now the soil, the raw material, the genetic material.
The form of this project is space:  physical space, virtual space, latent space, and the magic circle. This project wants to know embodiment at the intersection of virtual and physical, specifically how magic circles occupying privileged orientations inside the intersectional space of physical and virtual enable embodied navigation and play in latent space and how this play is powered by the assembly line networks of generative systems. 
 The vehicle we will drive through space is the human body in concert with mathematical computation. To illustrate with a specific example, we can apply linear algebra to compute and map the direction and distance between two text prompts existing in the latent space of their model. In this example we choose to drive the cartesian coordinates of this space by the human body as GPS position on Earth. In this way, one can take a walk through the latent space of a generative model. Interestingly, by selecting an audio diffusion model as our generative system and playing sampled outputs, one hears the latent space as one takes a physical walk. Building up this system as an assembly line of generative production, a new form of experience is made real. The investigation of these latent walks, the assembly lines that produce them, and the ramifications of this rupture in work and production for the individual and society is the focus of this research.
